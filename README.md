# GatherLite
This project is based of Forager and Gatherer and is only tested on World of Warcraft: Classic servers

GathererLite is an addon for herbalists, miners and treasure hunters in World of Warcraft: Classic. It's main purpose is to track the plants, deposits and treasure locations on your map.
The addon does not track like a tracking ability does, rather it "remembers" where you have found various items in the past. It does this whenever you gather (perform herbalism, mining or opening) on an item, and records the specific map location in its history.

When you view your World Map, you will also see the item locations marked on the particular map you are viewing there.

### TODO
* Add support for other languages
* Add configs elements to make it easier to use
* Add support for default icons if a node icon does not exists

### INSTALLATION
Extract the data to your "World of Warcraft/\_classic\_/Interface/AddOns" directory so that the "Gatherer" directory is a subdirectory of the "AddOns" directory.

### USAGE
Just use the game as normal.
When you gather things, they will appear on your minimap and your main map.

### CONTRIBUTING
Gatherer is an open source project, and is built upon the donations and the support of the community.
